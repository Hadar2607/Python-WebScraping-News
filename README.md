# Python-WebScraping-News
Receive news from 4 different sites (and send the news via email)

## Description:
* During my academic studies I do not have time to read news.
* Following this I developed in python a system that collects all the news of the day, keeps the news in a fileand even sends the file by email.

## Demonstration:

## news from site
